I have a general rule for trading sessions: If you have a choppy morning, you have a trending afternoon. If you have a trending morning, you have a choppy afternoon. This applies to 85% of sessions; the other 5% falls under trend days where the market moves one way.


You don't need to know what the price will do because NOBODY knows where the price is going. We have an idea, but that is not CERTAINTY. A calculated risk is not gambling. Insurance companies use an actuary to calculate risk. As traders, we take risks based on rules.

Trading is a game of stop-losses and mistakes. If you don't make big mistakes and keep losses small, you will make profits. The hardest thing in trading is letting your trades run so you can accumulate profits. You can't pay for the losses if you don't let your trades run.
