# Options Basics
- Options have greatest time value when strike is similar to spot (ie: ATM)
- ITM options trade less than OTM options as they are more expensive due to their positive intrinsic value
- Long vol strategies should have expiry just after key date
	- Conversely a short vol strategy should have an expiry just before the key date
- ITM options have highest return for 'normal' market moves
	- Due to their higher delta
- Forwards are better than options for pure directional plays
	- Forward: Contract that obliges the investor to buy a security on a certain expire date at a certain strike price. A forward has a delta of 100%. An ITM call option has a relatively small time value (compared to ATM) and a delta close to 100%
	- The advantage of options is in offering convexity: if markets move against the investor, the only loss i the premium paid whereas a forward has a virtually unlimited loss
- OTM options have highest return for abnormal moves
	- Low cost and high leverage compensates for their lower deltas
- Low strike puts are usually more liquid than high strike calls
	- Low-strike puts have a higher implied than high-strike calls
	- In addition, demand for protection lifts liquidity for low strikes
- Delta is not the probability option expires ITM
- Stock replacing with long call or short put
	- Replace stock with long calls when volatility is low
	- Replace stock with short puts when volatility is high
- Stock replacing via calls benefits from convexity
	- If a long position in the underlying is sold and replaced with calls of equal delta, then if the markets rise the delta increases and the calls make more money than the long position. Similarly, if markets fall the delta decreases and the losses are reduced. The downside of using calls is if the underlying does not move.
