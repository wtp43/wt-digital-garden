# Historical Performance
## Long-run average realized return
- If expected returns are constant over time, long-run average realized return is a good estimate of expected future return
	- Unexpected news dominates returns in the short run, but the effects are canceled out in long term
**Cons:**
- Any sample period may be biased
- Longer historical windows reduce sample specificity and enable more accurate estimates of average returns **but** distant historical data may be irrelevant due to structural changes
- Expected returns may vary over time. in cyclical fashion
- Historical performance data visible are often upward biased due to voluntary nature of performance reporting and survivorship bias
### Common findings
- Stock markets outperform fixed income markets
