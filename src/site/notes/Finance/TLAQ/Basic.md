# Terminology 
- A basis point is **one-hundredth of a percentage point**. For instance, one basis point equals 0.01%, or 0.0001. One hundred basis points equal 1%.


# Don't do dumb stuff
- Trading too much
- Trading too big
- Trying to be a hero

# Need a Realistic Plan
- Market is highly competitive
- You can't compete on speed or smarts
- You can compete in game selection
- Concentrate on doing useful things in uncompetitive places - just like any other business
	- Helping traders reduce their risk
	- Helping traders to satisfy dumb objectives

# Run it like a business
- You need to have confidence that you are doing things that are likely to make money. Not like drawing lines on charts, throwing price data at neural nets, or immersing themselves in financial media…

# Buy Cheap Sell Rich and Accepting/Managing Risk
- Without some risk, there can be no return
- First, we need to find other traders who are willing or forced to buy from us too cheap or sell to us too rich.
	- Picture the trader with large leveraged positions in a market crash. Risk metrics flashing red, they are forced to sell to cut size. The sellers will be forced to sell at a discount and you will be able to buy cheap if you get to trade them.
- You are in competition with other traders trying to do the same as you, not with those that you're trying to help out.
	- This suggests that we want to be helping those people in as uncompetitive an environment as you can find.
		- This means there's something unattractive about the opportunity
		- Bit murky, labor-intensive/capital-intensive, opportunity is small, low rewards
		- We need to find out why it sucks - because we want to know why we can compete at it
		- **_If you’ve found an opportunity and can’t identify what sucks about it, then you probably haven’t found an opportunity._**

# Focusing on what matters

A really common failure model in trading/investing is focusing on things that don't matter much because you think you could do better, so you think you should. But stuff gets complicated real fast whatever you do, so you have to be pretty ruthless about focusing on the things that actually matter and keeping everything else as simple as possible imo. Zen is in getting really good at the 20% that matters and letting the nerds waste their energy arguing about the 80% that does not. - Robotjames

# What is a Good trade
- A good trade isn't one that makes money
- A bad trade isn't one that loses money
- A good trade is one with positive expectation

# Unpredictable Randomness is a defining feature of financial market returns



# Don't be a Hero
- Plan for the worst case scenario
- Try to set things up so you're likely to make money even when you're wrong
- Keep trading strategies simple
- Assume things won't go the way you expect them to
- The more rules and parameters you add to a trading strategy, the more brittle it is likely to be and the less likely it is to be profitable in a range of future outcomes
	- An overly specific implementation of a good idea can lose money even if the core idea is sound

Get rid of all the Technical Analysis books and just go through all the US stocks and go back as far as you can to see how they move.
If you have a tiny account which is under 1 million, you should be focusing more on the small/micro cap stocks.. because there’s a lot more opportunity there.

Best runs in the indices are fuelled by low volume.
Best runs in the individuals are fuelled by high volume.

A truly successful trader focuses on their ability to get out of a losing trade as soon as possible. Most losing traders focus their determination to hang on to a losing trade and hope that it comes back. A great trader takes out the trash (losing trades) as soon as possible.

"selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds" - Berkshire Hathaway [$brk](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24brk&src=cashtag_click) annual letter, originally from Peter Lynch's "One Up on Wall Street"

Beginning traders want to predict the future on their charts. Winning to them means they are correct, and they feel like genius. When they lose, they feel horrible. Profitable traders trade what they see, not what they think. They are present and not thinking about the future.
