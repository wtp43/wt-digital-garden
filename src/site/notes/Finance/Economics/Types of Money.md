# Types of Money
## Bank Deposits ($15.5 Trillion)
In practice, can be seamlessly converted into government-issued fiat currencies in real time at a bank. Technically, it is an "IOU" from a bank that can become worthless if issuing bank goes bankrupt. There is much more money in bank deposits than there is in paper bills. Government provides 250k in FDIC deposit insurance for account holders. $15.5 trillion domestically.

## Government-Issued Fiat Currency ($2.1 Trillion)
Dollar bills. Currently $2.1 Trillion in circulation.

## Central bank reserves ($3 Trillion)
Special type of money issued by the Federal Reserve that only commercial banks can hold. "IOU" from the Federal Reserve. From a commercial bank's standpoint, currency and bank reserves are interchangeable (Convert bank reserves to fiat by ordering shipment of currency from Federal Reserve). Commercial banks use bank reserves when they pay each other or anyone else with a Fed Account. They use currency/bank deposits to apy everyone else. 

## Treasuries ($20 Trillion)
Money that pays interest. Useful for large institutional investor since they are not able to hold central bank reserves (not a bank) and it would not make sense to deposit all that at a commercial bank (only 250k is insured by the FDIC). 

Problems emerge when the conversion of all forms of money break down.
