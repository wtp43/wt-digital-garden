# Policy
- Denoted by $\mu$, the policy tells the agent what action to take at a particular state in the environment


# Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning
- Agent learns the good policy in an iterative process (Poly-based reinforcement learning method)
- The policy is initialized randomly at the start and is improved on until it yields the optimal policy
# Deterministic Policy
- In a deterministic policy, there is only one particular action possible in a given state. When the agent reaches a given state, the deterministic policy tells it to perform a particular action always. $$μ(s) = a$$
