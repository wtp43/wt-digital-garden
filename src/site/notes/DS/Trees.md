# Trees

It is usually easier to consider one-indexed arrays. Let the root be at index 1, then the two children of a node $i$ are at $2i$ and $2i + 1$
## Perfect Tree
- All its leaves are at the same distance from the root

## Quasi-Perfect tree
- All its leaves are on at most two levels. The second level form the bottom is completely full and all the leaves on the bottom level are grouped to the left. 

# Implementation

```python

```
