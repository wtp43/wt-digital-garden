# Task Switching
Every time you switch tasks, your brain makes that conductor do 4 different tasks (executive functions):

-   Stop/ Inhibit (pulling yourself away)
    
-   Switch (moving over to the next task)
    
-   Start (getting going on the new task)
    
-   Focus (zeroing in on that new task)


# Stop

## Use a timer (the more annoying, the better)
- Purpose: To pull your brain out of absorbing tasks
- To overcome hyper focus mode and ignoring the timer, get up and move after timer ends.

## Get up and move
- Move your body and your brain will start to follow

## Change your environment

## Accountability and Structure

## Make a list and time them right
- Make a list of all hard to stop activities. 
- Always try to do these things and improve switching


# Switch
## Build-in transition time
- Give some time between the hard stop of one thing and the beginning of another
- Need to sleep after working late at night? Take a shower before bed to allow your brain to switch gears

## Use Movement

## Turn on music



# Start
