# Implementation
```python
def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
	order_map = {}
	for index, val in enumerate(order):
		order_map[val] = index

	# iteratively compare all letters in words[i] and words[i+1]
	for i in range(len(words) - 1):
		for j in range(len(words[i])):
			
			# words[i] can't be a prefix of words[i+1] 
			# or else the order is wrong
			if j >= len(words[i + 1]): 
				return False
			# in the case that the current letter being compared
			# is different, words[i][j] must come before
			# words[i+1][j] in the order_map
			# we can break because they are in the right order
			if words[i][j] != words[i + 1][j]:
				if order_map[words[i][j]] > order_map[words[i + 1][j]]:
					return False
				break

	return True
