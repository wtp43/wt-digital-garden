Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
**Output:** 3

# DFS

```python
```python
def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        nr = len(grid)
        nc = len(grid[0])
        def dfs(grid, i, j):
            if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '1':
                return
            grid[i][j] = '0'
            dfs(grid, i-1, j)
            dfs(grid, i+1, j)
            dfs(grid, i, j-1)
            dfs(grid, i, j+1)
        
        islands = 0
        q = []
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    islands += 1
                    dfs(grid, i , j)
        return islands
```

# BFS (Optimal)
This only uses O(min(m,n)) space compared to O(mn) space for DFS and Union Find.
The traversal however must start at (0,0) for this to work.
Starting in the middle would result in O(m + n)
