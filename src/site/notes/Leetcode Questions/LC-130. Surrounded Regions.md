# Description
Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

**Input:** board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"\|"X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
**Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"\|"X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = [["X"\|"X"]]
**Output:** [["X"\|"X"]]

**Constraints:**

-   `m == board.length`
-   `n == board[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
-   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>It's important to realize that we are given which O's won't be converted and distinguish them from the rest of the O's. Knowing this, we can DFS out from the O's that won't be converted.

# Implementation
```python
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i < 0 or i >= n or j < 0 or j >= m \
                or board[i][j] == 'X' or board[i][j] == 'T':
                return
            if board[i][j] == 'O':
                board[i][j] = 'T'
            for x,y in dirs:
                dfs(i+x,j+y)


        dirs = [(0,1), (1,0), (-1,0), (0,-1)]
        n = len(board)
        m = len(board[0])
        for i in [0,n-1]:
            for j in range(m):
                if board[i][j] == 'O':
                    dfs(i,j)
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            for j in [0,m-1]:
                if board[i][j] == 'O':
                    dfs(i,j)

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if board[i][j] == 'O':
                    board[i][j]='X'
                elif board[i][j] == 'T':
                    board[i][j]='O'
```
