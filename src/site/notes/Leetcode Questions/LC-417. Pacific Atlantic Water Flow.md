# Description
There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return _a **2D list** of grid coordinates_ `result` _where_ `result[i] = [ri, ci]` _denotes that rain water can flow from cell_ `(ri, ci)` _to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/waterflow-grid.jpg)

**Input:** heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4\|1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
**Output:** [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0\|0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
**Explanation:** The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** heights = [[1\|1]]
**Output:** [[0,0\|0,0]]
**Explanation:** The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

**Constraints:**

-   `m == heights.length`
-   `n == heights[r].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
-   `0 <= heights[r][c] <= 105`

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>The naive approach would be to BFS from each cell. It repeats computation because any result can only be applied to that cell. Start from the ocean and work backwards. The results here are used for multiple cells because every cell we visit must be connected to the ocean.

# Implementation
```python
def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
	
	def dfs(i, j, prev_h, ocean):
		if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= n or j >= m or \
		(i,j) in ocean or prev_h > heights[i][j]:
			return
		ocean.add((i,j))
		for x, y in dirs:
			dfs(i+x, j+y, heights[i][j], ocean)
		
	dirs = [[0,1], [1,0], [-1,0],[0,-1]]
	pacific = set()
	atlantic = set()
	n = len(heights)
	m = len(heights[0])

	for i in range(n):
		dfs(i,0,heights[i][0], pacific)
		dfs(i,m-1,heights[i][m-1], atlantic)
	
	for j in range(m):
			dfs(0,j,heights[0][j], pacific)  
			dfs(n-1,j,heights[n-1][j], atlantic)
	return list(pacific.intersection(atlantic))
```
