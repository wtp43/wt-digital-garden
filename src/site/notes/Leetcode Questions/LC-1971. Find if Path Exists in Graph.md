# Description
Undirected graph with n vertices. Check if there is a path between two vertices.
# Brute Force
# Intuition

>Valid path? Union find or dfs

# Implementation
```python
def validPath(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
	graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
	for a, b in edges:
		graph[a].append(b)
		graph[b].append(a)
		
	seen = [False] * n
	
	def dfs(curr_node):
		if curr_node == destination:
			return True
		if not seen[curr_node]:
			seen[curr_node] = True
			for next_node in graph[curr_node]:
				if dfs(next_node):
					return True
		return False
		
	return dfs(source)
```
