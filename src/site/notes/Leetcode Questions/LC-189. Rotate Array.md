# Description

# Brute Force
# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>k rotations is the same as k mod n rotations.
>Reverse the whole string
>Reverse the first k. 0 based: 0 -> k-1 inclusive
>Reverse the k:n
>It's important to note that the next position is (current + k) % n

# Implementation
```python
 def reverse(self, nums: list, start: int, end: int) -> None:
        while start < end:
            nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
            start, end = start + 1, end - 1
                
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        n = len(nums)
        k %= n

        self.reverse(nums, 0, n - 1)
        self.reverse(nums, 0, k - 1)
        self.reverse(nums, k, n - 1)
```

>[!example]+ 
>```rust
Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result

## Cyclic Replacement

But, there could be a problem with this method, if n%k=0 where k=k%n (since a value of k larger than n eventually leads to a k equivalent to k%n). In this case, while picking up numbers to be placed at the correct position, we will eventually reach the number from which we originally started. Thus, in such a case, when we hit the original number's index again, we start the same process with the number following it.

```python
def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
	n = len(nums)
	k %= n
	
	start = count = 0
	while count < n:
		current, prev = start, nums[start]
		while True:
			next_idx = (current + k) % n
			nums[next_idx], prev = prev, nums[next_idx]
			current = next_idx
			count += 1
			
			if start == current:
				break
		start += 1
```
