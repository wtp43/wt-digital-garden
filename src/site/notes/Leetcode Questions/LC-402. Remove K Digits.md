# Description

# Brute Force
# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>It's important to figure out the criteria of when to add and pop to the stack. Let's store our possible digits in a stack.
>We want to pop a number from the resulting number stack if the cur number is smaller than the prev.
>It's also important that we iterate list to right.
>For instance A = 1axxx, B = 1bxxx. If a > b then A > B

# Implementation
```python
def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        count = 0
        stack = []
        
        for c in num:
            while k and stack and c < stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
                k -= 1
            stack.append(c)

        stack = stack[:-k] if k else stack

        return "".join(stack).lstrip("0") or "0"
```
