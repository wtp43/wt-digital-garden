# Description

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = ``[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3\|1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**`` [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals =`` [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2\|1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intervals =``[[1,2],[2,3\|1,2],[2,3]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>Two cases:
>1. If there is overlap then the start of the current interval is < the min_end
>	- count += 
>	- Update min_end to be the smaller of the two (this results in less overlaps)
>2. No overlap: start > min_end
>	- update min_end 

# Implementation
```python
def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()
        count = 0
        min_end = -math.inf

        for x,y in intervals:
            if x >= min_end:
                min_end = y
            else:
                min_end = min(y, min_end)
                count+=1
        return count
```
