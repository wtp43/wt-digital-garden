# Description

In this problem, a rooted tree is a **directed** graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with `n` nodes (with distinct values from `1` to `n`), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[ui, vi]`that represents a **directed** edge connecting nodes `ui` and `vi`, where `ui` is a parent of child `vi`.

Return _an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of_ `n` _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/graph1.jpg)

**Input:** edges = ``[[1,2],[1,3],[2,3\|1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]``
**Output:** ``[2,3]``

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/graph2.jpg)

**Input:** edges = ``[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5\|1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5]]``
**Output:** ``[4,1]``
# Intuition

> [!attention]+ Understand the given information.
> A valid graph in this context is a single rooted tree with no cycles.
> This graph is given a single extra edge. 


> [!question]+ Questions to ask before attempting to solve
> **How can a graph be invalid?**
> Either one node has two in-edges or there is a cycle.
> 
> **Which edges can be invalid? **
> Either one of two edges that enter the same node or an edge in the cycle.


>[!danger]+ Intuition
> Cycle detection? -> Union Find or DFS

# Implementation
```python
def findRedundantDirectedConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
	class Union_find:
		def __init__(self):
			self.parent = {}
			self.size = defaultdict(lambda:1)
			self.prev = {}
			self.in_edges = defaultdict(int)

		def find(self, i):
			if self.parent[i] != i:
				self.parent[i] = self.find(self.parent[i])
			return self.parent[i]

		def union(self, x, y):
			r1 = self.find(x)
			r2 = self.find(y)
			if r1 == r2:
				print('err:',x,y)
				return [x,y]
			
			if self.size[r1] < self.size[r2]:
				self.parent[r1] = r2
				self.size[r2] += self.size[r1]
			else:
				self.parent[r2] = r1
				self.size[r1] += self.size[r2]
			return None
	
		def remove_edge(self, edges):
			invalid_edge1 = []
			invalid_edge2 = []
			for u, v in edges:
				self.in_edges[v] += 1
				if self.in_edges[v] > 1:
					invalid_edge1 = [u,v]
					invalid_edge2 = [self.prev[v], v]
				if u not in self.parent:
					self.parent[u] = u
				if v not in self.parent:
					self.parent[v] = v
				self.prev[v] = u
				
			for u, v in edges:
				if [u,v] == invalid_edge1: continue
				edge = self.union(u,v)
				if edge:
					if not invalid_edge1:
						return edge
					else:
						return invalid_edge2
					
			return invalid_edge1
	
	uf = Union_find()

	return uf.remove_edge(edges)
       
```

>[!example]+ 
>Invalid graph containing a node with two parents/in-edges
>**Input:** edges = `[[2,1],[3,1],[4,2],[1,4]]`
>**Output**: `[2,1]`
>Store (2,1) and (3,1) as potential invalid edges.
>Either you build a valid tree without (2,1) and return (2,1) or you get an error (parent(u) == parent(v)) and return (3,1)
>In this case, while trying to build the tree while skipping (3,1), you run into parent(1) == 4 == parent(4) while inserting (1,4). 


> [!example]+ 
> **Input:** edges = `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5]]`
**Output:** `[4,1]`
> Here, no node has 2 parents. All we have to do is find a cycle and return the last edge that makes it a cycle.
