# Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

-   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any**of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = ``[[1,0\|1,0]]
**Output:** ``[0,1]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is ``[0,1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites =``[[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2\|1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
**Output:** ``[0,2,1,3]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is``[0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
**Output:** [0]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
-   `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
-   `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
-   `ai != bi`
-   All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>Identify which way the edges are directed (look at what the solution requires). In this case, the answer requires the prerequisites to come before the courses. Topological sort appends left in a deque. 

# Implementation
```python
def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        def dfs_topsort(node):
            if vis[node] == 2:
                return True
            elif vis[node] == 1:
                return False
            vis[node] = 1
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                print('neighbor',neighbor)
                if not dfs_topsort(neighbor):
                    return False
            vis[node] = 2
            order.appendleft(node)
            return True
        
        order = deque()
        graph = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        vis = defaultdict(int)

        for i,j in prerequisites:
            graph[j].append(i)

        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs_topsort(i):
                return []
        return order
```
