```python
def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
	post_crash = []
	for x in asteroids:
		while post_crash and x < 0 < post_crash[-1]:
			if -x > post_crash[-1]:
				post_crash.pop()
				continue
			elif -x == post_crash[-1]:
				post_crash.pop()
			break
		else:
			post_crash.append(x)

	return post_crash
```

# Interesting use case of while else:
The `else` clause is executed if you exit a block normally, by hitting the loop condition or falling off the bottom of a try block. It is _not_ executed if you `break` or `return` out of a block, or raise an exception. It works for not only while and for loops, but also try blocks. You typically find it in places where normally you would exit a loop early, and running off the end of the loop is an unexpected/unusual occasion. For example, if you're looping through a list looking for a value:

```python
for value in values:
    if value == 5:
        print "Found it!"
        break
else:
    print "Nowhere to be found. :-("
```
