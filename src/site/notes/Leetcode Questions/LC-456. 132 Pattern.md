# Description
Given an array of `n` integers `nums`, a **132 pattern** is a subsequence of three integers `nums[i]`, `nums[j]` and `nums[k]` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]`.

Return `true` _if there is a **132 pattern** in_ `nums`_, otherwise, return_ `false`_._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,1,4,2]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,3,2,0]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].

**Constraints:**

-   `n == nums.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 2 * 105`
-   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

Preprocess min stack
Since we want i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j], it would be useful to have the minimum nums[i] at each iteration. 


So the behavior after performing the precomputation is as follows:

1.  For the current j value, let's check if some values from the stack are no longer viable, i.e. they are <= min[j]. If that is the case, they can never be a possible nums[k], because as we move j further to the left, the min[j] values will only increase or stay the same. So let's just pop them.
2.  Now lets quickly check if the current j satisfies the conditions we need, i.e. min[j] < nums[j] > st.peek(), if yes then just return true
3.  If it did not satisfy the conditions, figure out whether it is a viable nums[k] and if so, put it in the stack. As we know the only condition to check is whether nums[j] > min[j], if that is true, put it in the stack.

You may be wondering why we only check the top of the stack, and not all values in the stack. This is because luckily as we build the stack, we ALWAYS end up getting the smallest value at the top. To understand this, all you need to know is that IF we are pushing a value on the stack, we already know 2 things - either the stack is empty OR (the stack has elements greater than min[j] AND the nums[j] you are trying to push on the stack is less than st.peek()). Why? Because if nums[j] were larger than stack top, we would have already found a solution! So it has to be smaller or equal to the st.peek, and we push it in always in this same order.

And because the answer we are searching requires nums[k] > nums[j] for j < k, we can guarantee that our stack of nums[k] is a min stack. Otherwise, we would have already reached a solution.


# Implementation
```python
def find132pattern(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return False
        stack = []
        min_array = [-1] * len(nums)
        min_array[0] = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            min_array[i] = min(min_array[i - 1], nums[i])

        for j in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            if nums[j] <= min_array[j]:
                continue
            while stack and stack[-1] <= min_array[j]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack and stack[-1] < nums[j]:
                return True
            stack.append(nums[j])
        return False
```
