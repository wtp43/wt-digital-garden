# Description
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false`_otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = ``[2,3,1,1,4]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = ``[3,2,1,0,4]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>Keep track of the maximum distance you can jump if iterating from the start of the array. Iterating backwards is more intuitive. We can shift back the end goal by taking the maximum number of steps at each point.

# Implementation
```python
def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
	goal = len(nums) - 1

	for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):
		if i + nums[i] >= goal:
			goal = i
	return goal == 0
```
