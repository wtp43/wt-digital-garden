# Description
Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word2.jpg)

**Input:** board =`` [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"\|"A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word-1.jpg)

**Input:** board =`` [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"\|"A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/word3.jpg)

**Input:** board =`` [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"\|"A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

-   `m == board.length`
-   `n = board[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 6`
-   `1 <= word.length <= 15`
-   `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>Pruning: Reduce the number of times we start backtracking. If the starting letter occurs more than the last letter in the board, search the reverse.
>Keep track of cells that have been visited on the current path.


# Implementation
```python
def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
	n, m = len(board), len(board[0])
	l = len(word)
	seen = set()
	dirs = [[0,1], [1,0], [-1,0], [0,-1]]

	def backtrack(i, r, c):
		if i >= l:
			return True
		if r >= n or c >= m or min(r,c) < 0 \
			or board[r][c] != word[i] \
			or (r,c) in seen:
			return False
		# add this cell to seen so we don't visit it again
		seen.add((r,c))
		res = False
		for x,y in dirs:
			res = res or backtrack(i+1, x+r, y+c)
		seen.remove((r,c))
		return res

	# pruning: reverse the string if freq of first
	# char is less than the last one
	# this results in less starting cells for dfs

	count = defaultdict(int)
	for i in range(n):
		for j in range(m):
			count[board[i][j]] += 1
	if count[word[0]] > count[word[-1]]:
		word = word[::-1]

	for i in range(n):
		for j in range(m):
			if backtrack(0,i,j):
				return True
	return False
```
