# Questions before solving/for the Interviewer (Assumptions to be made)

## Input
- What type of input will we be given?
	- Integer, string, list
	- will it be sorted?


## Graphs
- Can we assume there are no cycles?
	- Not needed if structure is a tree


# What are the assumptions?
Question the validity of your assumptions

**Interview Tip:** Practice Overriding Your Brains "Assume" Mode!

We humans have a habit of making a lot of assumptions - neurobiologists reassure us that this is quite normal! If we didn't make lots of assumptions, our brains would slow to a crawl like a poorly maintained computer, thanks to the overload of additional information they'd have to process.

In an interview situation, where most of us are at least a little nervous, we are even less likely to question our assumptions. The moment most of us realize that we can solve the problem using the top-to-bottom approach, we will be frantically coding it up to show our interviewer that we can solve the problem.

But this isn't ideal! In an interview, and when solving difficult problems in general, you need to learn to identify the assumptions you're making, and question them in your mind. In some problems, this can be things like assuming that input is sorted, that there will be no invalid cases, that they won't mind you overwriting the input, or even that the environment is single-threaded. In this case, the assumption is assuming that the only way of solving this problem is to work from top to bottom.

The only way to get good at challenging your assumptions is lots of practice. Working in a group with other people preparing for code interviews can help too - learning how other people see problems will widen your own way of seeing problems.
