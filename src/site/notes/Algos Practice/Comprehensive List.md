- [ ] Two Pointers
# Improving Intuition

- When there is no obvious solution, try brute forcing
	- How to determine if current word in path (word``[i:j]``) is a palindrome? Sol: Iterate the entirety of the word instead of determining the palindrome concurrently with DFS
	- Make Number of Distinct Characters Equal: Swap every character in each word with each other

- [ ] Trie Problems
# Recognizing NP-Hard Problems
Subset Sum if finding all subsets
- Reduced to O(sum$*$n) using DP if using just finding one
# Competitive Programming


# How to Approach a Problem During an Interview
- Ask about the input data
	- What are it's characteristics?
	- Can we assume that it is 
		- unique
		- sorted
		- Type of Data? Integer, String

- [ ] **System and OO design Principles (sometimes)**
    - Some compaines ask Object Oriented questions. A great great resource for this is the book "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin. I also highly recommend his book "Clean Code" but it won't help you for interviews (but will make you a better programmer)
