# Ingredients
- 1¼ cup heavy whipping cream, cold
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 (8-ounce) mascarpone cheese, cold
- 2 cups strong brewed coffee or espresso (see notes)
- 1 (7-ounce) package ladyfingers (or savoiardi)
- 2 tablespoons EACH: granulated sugar AND cocoa powder, for dusting
- 2 tablespoons spiced rum (optional)

Use 1/4 sugar as stated in recipe or omit the granulated sugar from the recipe

# Instructions
1. **WHIP IT GOOD:** Add the heavy cream into the bowl on a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat for 30 seconds. Then, add the powdered sugar and the vanilla and continue to whip until the whipped cream starts to thicken into a super soft cream. Add the mascarpone cheese and continue to run the mixer on medium until the cream fluffs up and stiff peaks form. When it doubt, stop the mixer and mix using a spatula, you don’t want to over mix this or it will turn to butter!
2. **ESPRESSO:** While the mixer is running, combine the prepared espresso and the granulated sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves.
3. **LAYER IT:** Grab an 8x8 baking dish (or something similar in size.) Do a quick dip of the ladyfinger into the prepared espresso and place them in a single layer in the baking dish (about 9-10 ladyfingers.) Spread half of the prepared mascarpone mixture on top of the layer of ladyfingers and spread using an offset spatula. Make a second layer of ladyfingers by quickly dipping them in espresso and laying them side by side. Spread or pipe the remaining mascarpone cream on top. 
4. **DUST IT OFF:** Place the cocoa powder in a small sieve and dust the top of the tiramisu. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours. I prefer to make this one day ahead of when I plan on serving it as it cuts cleaner pieces! It’s the ideal make-ahead dessert!

# Tips
- When mixing the mascarpone, don’t skimp on the bowl. Use a large mixing bowl. Always use chilled mascarpone cheese straight from the refrigerator.
- Don’t soak! Quickly dip the cookies into your coffee or liquor. Try not to leave them in the liquid too long—a quick dip will do. Overly soggy cookies make for a wet texture and a messy dessert.
- Mix up your flavors. Keep it classic with fresh brewed (or [instant](https://www.delallo.com/delallo-instant-espresso-coffee-powder-1-94-oz/)) espresso or switch things up with a liquor like rum, amaretto, sambucca or Irish cream. Don’t be afraid to experiment with fruit for a non-coffee version. Use fruit purees or natural juices to give your tiramisu an extra summery flavor.
- Switch up the layers. When building your tiramisu, criss-cross cookie layers to create a sturdier dessert. This way allows for easier cutting and better presentation. (So your tiramisu won’t look like the Leaning Tower of Pisa).
- Line your pan. Line your pan with plastic wrap before building your tiramisu. When you’re ready to remove the trifle (after it has chilled), you can more easily flip the dessert onto a serving dish and get the full effect of your layered dessert without it falling over.
- Be patient. Once you whip it up, cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before serving. This gives the dessert time to develop its rich cocoa flavor.
- When storing the tiramisu in the refrigerator, be sure to cover with a lid or wrap tightly with plastic wrap so that no odours from the refrigerator seep into the dessert.
- Leftovers can be covered and stored in the fridge for up to 4 days. Tiramisu can be made and frozen for up to 3 months
